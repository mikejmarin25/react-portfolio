# [React Portfolio](https://mikejmarin25.github.io/react-portfolio/#/)

## Description
This is my deployed React portfolio. I am a full-stack web developer, completing a coding bootcamp from The University of Miami.
In the future, I plan on progressing my skills working as a web developer.I built this portfolio using REACT, 
which I enjoyed more than I expected.

Feel free to contact me with any question regarding my experience or previously completed projects that I have outlined in this portfolio.
